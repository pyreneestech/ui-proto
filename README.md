# Introduction

This template is used for prototyping ui relates issues in a variety of technologies such as:

* [**Pug**](https://pugjs.org), formally Jade, an HTML processor.
* [**Stylus**](http://stylus-lang.com), a CSS processor.
* [**Bootstrap**](http://http://getbootstrap.com/), styling from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).
* [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/), a [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html) processor.
* [**React**](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a UI development tool for the web.
* [**Markdown**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), a markup language.

It has a simple node server to translate Pug views into HTML and Stylus templates into CSS. Everything else is handled in the browser, Bootstrap, ES2015 (Babel), Markdown, React, and XJS (Babel).

# Usage

Execute the server:

```
node server.js
```
then load `localhost:8080` in the browser.

Make a change to any of the files in 'views' or 'public' directory and reload the page.
